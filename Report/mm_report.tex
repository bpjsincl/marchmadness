% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/




%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

Bracket and Game prediction is continually growing in popularity due to revenue production over various gambling mediums.
(CHANGE: One subset of this industry is through the )March Madness sporting event held every year, with competing 'A' Division NCAA college basketball teams. 
The researchers will attempt to use machine-learning techniques to predict the winners of this 64 team single knock-out tournament, and will do so through calculating the probability of that outcome occurring for each round of play.
The previous seasons will assist in the process of training and testing and models will be benchmarked against specific seasons.
Many tactics are currently being reasearched and employed, such as: ANNs, varying regression techniques, probabalistic optimization, SVM's, and genetic algorithms.
However, due to high uncertainty in outcomes, none have been extremely accurate.
The researchers will apply Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forests, and use regression models to potentially reduce the feature space.
In order determine if the technique is successful, the researchers will use Logarithmic Loss and will assess the performance on the 2014 tournament.

\section{Introduction}
March Madness is a 64 team, single-knockout tournament <finish this scentence explaining MM>.
Betting on this tournament is extremely popular and a total of \$12 billion was spent on gambling related bets in 2012 \cite{BradTuttle-2012}. 
The most popular bet made comes in the form of the March Madness bracket. So popular that more Americans filled out a bracket in 2012 than voted in the Presidential Election \cite{DavidHolmes-2013}. 
Predicting this bracket includes choosing the winner of each game in the tournament for each of the six rounds. 
The difficulty of predicting a perfect March Madness bracket is widely known and accepted and Warren Buffet has even offered a \$1 billion cash prize to anyone who is successful \cite{wbuff_bill}.

Attempts to perfectly predict March Madness results using Machine Learning techniques has seen a recent surge in popularity. 
Hand calculated predictions used to be the norm, but more advanced MI techniques are starting to be used with the wealth of data now available online. 
However, there is no greed upon or industry standardized method for predicting a bracket, or even the outcome of a basketball game. 
Many tactics are used, such as: neural nets \cite{KarlLeswing}, varying regression and probabalistic optimization techniques \cite{adams-dahl-murray-2010a, DannyTarlow, BradyWest, BradleyCarlin, ProbModelsNCAA-1991, MoreProbModelsNCAA-1996}, support vector machines \cite{KennethDeakins}, and genetic algorithms \cite{ScottTurner}, but due to high uncertainty in outcomes, none have been extremely accurate, and continuous improvements are being made.

Kaggle, a machine-learning competition repository, held a competition this year for predicting the outcome of each possible matchup in the March Madness tournament.
The researchers did not compete, but will use the data provided (along with that from external sources) and results to analyse their performance.
Kaggle provides some data, which includes player, team, season, and tournament data from the past 18 NCAA seasons.
Other data sources will be incorporated in the models <to improve stuff, get more information about teams, etc.>
The researchers will use Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks, to predict winners and associated probability of occurence for each round of play, for the 64 teams.
<Previous seasons will assist in the process of training and testing, and results benchmarked against specific seasons and Kaggle competition results.>


\section{Data Gathering and Feature Selection}
The data used for creating predictions was gathered from multiple sources. Firstly, the Kaggle competition data served as a base of information, giving seasons, teams, game results, and tournament matchups.
Nest, statistics were integrated into to this dataset, representing the features for each team. These were obtained from renowned NCAA statstician, Ken Pomeroy (also known as ``kenpom''). KenPom has extensive data available on every NCAA Division I basketball team, which serves as the basis for learning in this project. The researchers were only able to obtain team-wide data, but in the future could potentially utilize KenPom's player-specific data as well \cite{KenPom}. A subset of the statistics used is seen below. A total of 30 statistics from KenPom are used as features for each team.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Tempo
  \item Adjusted Tempo
  \item Offensive Efficiency
  \item Defensive Efficiency
  \item Pythagorean Strength of Schedule
  \item Offensive Rebounding Percentage
  \item Free Throw Rate
  \item Effective Field Goal Percentage Against
\end{itemize}

%\begin{longtable}[H] {|p{1cm}|p{1cm}|p{1cm}|}
%\hline
%    Tempo                                   & Adjusted Tempo                  & Offensive Efficiency                    \\ \hline
%    Adjusted Offensive Efficiency           & Defensive Efficiency            & Adjusted Defensive Efficiency           \\ \hline
%    Pythagorean Strength of Schedule        & Effective Field Goal Percentage & Effective Field Goal Percentage         \\ \hline
%    Turnover Percentage                     & Offensive Rebounding Percentage & Free Throw Rate                         \\ \hline
%    Effective Field Goal Percentage Against & Turnover Percentage Against     & Offensive Rebounding Percentage Against \\ \hline
%    \label{tab:stats}

%\end{longtable}

To select the best features, the researchers conducted step-wise regression to construct a simpler model. The final set of features used is found in Table~\ref{tab:features}. Features with the highest predictive power are: (LIST FEATUERES POTENTIALLY).

Talk about different testing methods here!!!!

\section{Random Forest}
The first method used is Random Forests. Random Forests combine the benefits of using simple decision trees and the complexity of esemble learning methods. They are a collection of decision tress that contribute to the overall class vote. The class with the highest number of votes results in the class assignment. This is beneficical because it allows the researchers to extract the probabilities of each class assignment. 

The Random Forest is constructed using python's Sklearn package. The classification will undergo the three testing methods as described previously. In the cross-validation testing the Random Forest parameters will be tweaked and used in all subsequent tests. Three parameters are chosen to alter the performance of the Random Forest: number of estimators (the number of trees in the forest), the number of jobs to run in parallel for both fit and predict, and the maximum depth of the tree. The cross-validation performance and the corresponding parameter values can be found in Table ~\ref{tab:RF_CV}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{n\_jobs} & \textbf{n\_estimators} & \textbf{max\_depth} \\ \hline
    56\%     & 1       & 10            & NONE       \\ \hline
    58\%     & 1       & 5             & 10         \\ \hline
    59\%     & 1       & 15            & 5          \\ \hline
    60\%     & 2       & 15            & 5          \\ \hline
    59\%     & 2       & 15            & 15         \\ \hline
    59\%     & 2       & 15            & NONE       \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption {Random Forest Cross-Validation}
    \label{tab:RF_CV}
\end{table}

The cross-validation test was carried out by setting 30\% of the training data to act as the testing data. The percentage was then calculated based on the number of correctly predicted matchups (predicting correctly when team A or team B wins) divided by the total number of matchups (including false negatives and false positive errors).  Based on the cross-validation, the Random Forest performs with approximately 60\% accuracy with parameters $n\_jobs$ = 2, $n\_estimators$ = 15, and $max\_depth$ = 5. The Random Forest classifier uses these values in all subsequent simulations.

Moving forward, the Log Loss value was extracted and found to be <INSER LOG LOSS>.

The overall tournament accuracy for the 2013 season was run 5 different times to account for the randomness in the model. The results can be found in Table~\ref{tab:thetable}.

The distribution of the simulations is approximately 54\%. The accuracy is lower than the training validation but not by a large amount. This results from the large number of upsets in the 2013 tournament compared to previous years.
